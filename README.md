# image2textSR
Copy text from image using screenshot tool in any linux distro...

Make sure you have python3... If you don't have python3 and rather have python, then you have to change the firstOneTimeRun.sh and replace python3 with python one time...

<code>
sudo chmod +x firstOneTimeRun.sh
./firstOneTimeRun.sh
</code>

From now on, just type
<code>image2textSR</code>
on terminal and voila, see the magic!!!

<h1>I have used flameshot as screenshot tool here... Take a tour in <a href="https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot">the github page</a> of flameshot.....</h1>
